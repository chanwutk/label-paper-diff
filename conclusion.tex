\section{Conclusion}

We have developed an \emph{occupancy bitmap} that efficiently detects overlappings of labels to graphical marks and other labels in a chart.
The bitmap is used in a greedy-based labeling algorithm to quickly label charts.
We show that this labeling algorithm can label scatter/connected scatter plots, line charts, cartographic maps, and their combinations.
We compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art Particle-Based Labeling algorithm.
Our algorithm is significantly faster and able to place similar numbers of labels in charts.
