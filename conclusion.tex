\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We present \emph{occupancy bitmap}, a data structure that can efficiently detect overlaps between a label and other marks or labels in a chart.
We apply this bitmap in a greedy label placement algorithm and apply it to label scatter plots, connected scatter plots, 
line charts, and maps.
We compare this Bitmap-Based Labeling algorithm with the state-of-the-art Particle-Based Labeling algorithm,
showing that the Bitmap-Based algorithm is significantly faster and can place similar numbers of labels in charts.

For future work, we plan to apply occupancy bitmaps to label other charts that 
need a different placement strategy other than the 8-position model used in this paper. 
For example, stacked area charts need a method to place a label inside each area shape.

For chart interactions like zooming or panning, a na{\"\i}ve greedy label placement algorithm may re-render label placements 
for every frame of animations, which can be too slow for large datasets.
We plan to explore better optimization to avoid re-rendering in every new frame,
while providing smooth interactions.
