\section{Conclusion}

We have developed an \emph{occupancy bitmap} that efficiently detects overlappings of labels to graphical marks and other labels in a chart.
The bitmap is used in a greedy-based labeling algorithm to quickly label charts.
We show that this labeling algorithm can label scatter/connected scatter plots, line charts, cartographic maps, and their combinations.
We compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art Particle-Based Labeling algorithm.
Our algorithm is significantly faster and able to place similar numbers of labels in charts.

\section{Future Work}

In future work, we would like to apply our \emph{occupancy bitmap} and our algorithm to label other types of charts.
For example, area charts are widely used but are not supported by our current labeling algorithm since they have different positioning of labels.
Fortunately, our \emph{occupancy bitmap} can be used to detect overlapping of labels and areas.
Our bitmap is designed to be a module for labeling algorithms, so it can be swapped into other labeling algorithms implemented in the future that make use of it to label area charts.
