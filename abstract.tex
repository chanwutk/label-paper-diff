Legible labels should not overlap with other marks in a chart.
The state-of-the-art labeling algorithm detects overlaps using a set of points to approximate each mark's shape.
This approach is inefficient for large marks or many marks as it requires too many points to detect overlaps.
In response, we present a novel label placement algorithm, which leverages \emph{occupancy bitmaps} to accelerate overlap detection.
To create an occupancy bitmap, we project all marks onto a bitmap based on the area they occupy in the chart.
The projection is image-based, so it supports projections of marks with any shape.
With the bitmap, we can efficiently place labels without overlapping existing marks,
regardless of the number and geometric complexity of the marks.
Our algorithm offers significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art approach
while maintaining a similar level of visual quality.
